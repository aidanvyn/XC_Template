  <p>"The Skyline girls cross country team took on the Jackson Invitational bright and early, showcasing their grit and determination despite the fact that most of us were still rolling out of bed. Racing in the cool morning air, the girls gave it their all and finished a solid 19th out of 29 teams—proof that Skyline doesn’t just rise early, they rise to the occasion.Leading the team was Becca Van Lent, who powered through the course to finish with a time of 19:57.87, setting the pace for her teammates. Not far behind was Isla Tharp, clocking in at 20:12.31 with a personal record, and she certainly earned her spot at the breakfast table.Continuing the strong effort, Lila Edison crossed the finish line with a personal best of 20:46.19, while Alison Kauffman made her mark with a time of 21:38.28. The pack was rounded out by Mara Mocanu, who finished in 21:40.87, securing Skyline’s position for the day."</p>
